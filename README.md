# NLP Preprocessing

This project is one of Insight Data Science's open initiative projects proposed by Manu Ameisen. This project aims to address the pain points of the lack of best practices and resources/libraries available for natural language processing (NLP) workflows by taking a significant part of a typical NLP workflow and building a service around it so data scientists can focus their work on modeling and other aspects of the workflow.

Specifically, this natural language vectorization service encapsulates three major steps necessary in a typically NLP workflow, namely: data cleaning, data preprocessing, and word vector generation.
